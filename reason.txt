IceJato INC#3933 Was asking to join my development team and asked to show his work, he refused. 
After many messages, he desided he would not join. I was told in a vc by other devs in a community server that he 
is trying to get access to your products and leak them. He doesn't even code. I asked to see his supposed java code but he said 
"your tryna hack me"
attached is a video of DMs.
